# The Oxygen Programming Language

Nitrogen pip downloads: [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/oxygen-lang)](https://pepy.tech/project/oxygen-lang)


A simple programming language based on Python for beginners about to start programming.

Oxygen is simple and fast. It only requires Python for it to run.

## How to install


### Directly (for real use)
Install Oxygen by downloading our repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjunj132/oxygen.git
cd oxygen
```

Note for faster version, use minified - no packages:

```bash
cd min
```

Then just simply write commands in a `oxy` file, and type:

```bash
python3 -m runfile file.oxy
```

Or, just use the CLI:

```bash
python3 -m cli
```

Then use commands like normal.

### Nitrogen (just try it out)

Nitrogen is a way to easily install and run Oxygen. Just download `nitrogen.py` (or `min/nitrogen.py` for faster - no packages) from  GitHub and you run it and volia! Oxygen is installed and you have a enviroment to run it safely. Note that Nitrogen installed a edited version of Oxygen that is almost the same as the regular but will only work in the Nitrogen editor.


:warning: Note that Nitrogen is new and has lots of issues. PLEASE DON'T USE NITROGEN IF YOU ARE DOING SOME SERIOUS PROJECT. 


#### pip

You can install Nitrogen directly via pip. Just check out the page at https://pypi.org/project/oxygen-lang/.

Install using pip:
```
pip install oxygen-lang
```

Then import in the python shell and install:

```python
Python 3.9.2 (default, Feb 28 2021, 17:03:44) 
[GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
